Files on this folder:\
\
**lists.h:** Header file with definition of linked list and prototypes of functions for all tasks.\
**0-print_listint.c:** Function that prints all the elements of a linked list and returns the number of nodes that it contains. usage: print_listint(h); where h is a pointer to the list to be printed.\
**1-listint_len.c:** Function that returns the length of a linked list. Usage: listint_len(h); Where h is a pointer to the list.\
**2-add_nodeint.c:** Function that adds a node to the beggining of a linked list and returns a pointer to the new node. Usage: add_nodeint(head, n) Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list, and n is the number to initialize the element.\
**3-add_nodeint_end.c:** Function that adds a new node to the end of a linked list. Usage: add_nodeint_end(head, n) Where head is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list, and n is the number to initialize the element.\
**4-free_listint.c:** Function that frees a linked list. Usage: free_listint(head); Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list.\
**5-free_listint2.c:** Function that frees a linked list and sets head pointer to NULL. Usage: free_listint2(head); Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list.\
**6-pop_listint.c:** Function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodes data (n). Usage: pop_listint(head); Where head is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list.\
**7-get_nodeint.c:** Function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list. Usage: get_nodeint_at_index(head, index); Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list and index is the index of the desired element.\
**8-sum_listint.c:** Function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list. Usage: sum_listint(head); Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list.\
**9-insert_nodeint.c:** Function that inserts a new node at a given position. Usage: insert_nodeint_at_index(head, idx, n); Where head is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list, idx is the index for the new node, and n is the number to initialize the new node.\
**10-delete_nodeint.c:** Function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list. Usage: delete_nodeint_at_index(head, index); Where head is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list, and index is the index of the element to delete.\
**100-reverse_listint.c:** Function that reverses a listint_t linked list. Usage: reverse_listint(head); Where head is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list.\
**101-print_listint_safe.c:** Function that prints a listint_t linked list. Usage: print_listint_safe(head); Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list.
**102-free_listint_safe.c:** Function that frees a listint_t list. Usage: free_listint_safe(h); Where h is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list.\
**103-find_loop.c:** Function that finds the loop in a linked list. Usage: find_listint_loop(head); Where head is a pointer to the first element of the list.
